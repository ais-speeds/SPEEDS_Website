Dr Andrew Govus is a Senior Lecturer in Sport and Exercise Science at La Trobe University, specialising in sports physiology. He has previously worked with the Australian Institute of Sport and Swedish Winter Sport Research Centre to provide sport science support to elite athletes. His research interests include:

1. **Iron deficiency**: Understanding, preventing, and treating exercise-induced iron deficiency.

2.	**The female athlete**: Understanding the influence of the menstrual cycle on female athlete health and performance.

3.	**Athlete phenomics**: Using a combination of metabolomics and epigenetics methods to understand the biochemical pathway altered by exercise training using minimally invasive collection methods (e.g., capillary blood sampling, dried blood spots, urine).

4.	**Wearable technology**: The design, data analysis and implementation factors related to wearable biosensors.

5.	**Environmental physiology**: The body's response to hypoxia and heat exposure.

6.	**Applied statistics**: Enhancing data science skills within the profession of sport and exercise science.
